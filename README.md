# garden-planner

A garden planner created using Express, PostgreSQL, and Prisma ORM as a personal project for my fullstack web development portfolio.

Users can create an account, search for plants and add them to their virtual garden. They can see details for each plant, including care details. A calendar is created for each garden, letting the user know what care their plants need each month.

Plant search results are provided using the Perenual API (https://perenual.com/docs/api) and added to a PostgreSQL database using Prisma ORM.
